# Personal Budget

## A simple Excel spreadsheet to help manage personal finances.

I created this spreadsheet to improve my financial organization, build a financial plan, and track where my money was going. My goal was to keep it simple and user-friendly, with each financial transaction entered on a single line, ***automatically updating*** all related sheets.

### 2 - Tracking Financial Operations (Balance & Tracking Sheet)

Go to the **Balance & Tracking** sheet. This sheet includes tables and a graph that automatically update based on your entries in the **Tracking** table.

---

### 2.1 - Monthly Summary Table

- In **cell B2**, the month updates automatically based on the date entered in **cell C7**.
- The summary below displays:
  - **Balance** ‚Äì Income minus expenses, plus any carry-over from the previous month.
  - **Monthly expenses**
  - **Net salary** ‚Äì Can be toggled via **cell B4**.

---

### 2.2 - Expenses & Net Salary Graph

- A visual overview of your expenses and net salary for the selected month.
- Toggle between views using **cell B4**.

---

### 2.3 - Account Table

- View an overview of your accounts (e.g., bank, savings, debt, credit card).
- Use **cell C7** to select a date and see projected account balances for that day. If left blank, it defaults to today (`=TODAY()` in Excel).
- When logging a credit card purchase in the **Tracking** table, **cell C13** changes color to indicate a payment is due.
  - To record a payment, select **'Payment'** as the operation and choose **'Credit Card'** under **'Account'**. The same applies to **Debt**.
- Use the **Debt** account for upcoming transactions that don‚Äôt yet have an assigned payment method. When the date arrives, update it to the appropriate account (e.g., **Bank**, **Cash**, or **Savings**).

---

### 2.4 - Tracking Table

- This is the core of the spreadsheet. Enter each financial operation by selecting a category and entering the amount.
- All other tables and graphs update automatically based on this table.
- üí° *Tip: Press the `Tab` key to move between fields and quickly create a new row at the bottom.*

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Date Logic

The date of an operation affects **Accounts** and **Monthly Balance** differently:

- Operations **dated in the future** affect **only the Monthly Balance** for the current month.
- Operations **dated today or earlier** affect **both Accounts and Monthly Balance**.

As a result:

- If the values of **Accounts** and **Monthly Balance** match, **cell C3 turns green**.
- If they differ, **cell C3 turns orange** to signal a mismatch.

## üí° Tips

You can create a financial plan by entering future-dated operations.  
For example: salaries, bills, travel, and deductions you expect in the coming months.  
This helps you make better decisions by forecasting your financial situation.
